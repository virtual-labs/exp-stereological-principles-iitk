### About the Experiment 

Stereology is an important tool used for the geometrical characterization of microstructures. This microstructural characterization means geometrical characterization such as volume fraction of second phase, particle size distribution, size distribution of grains, density of dislocations. Microstructures evolves due to processing done in the material which in turn governs the properties of the materials and therefore characterization of microstructure is an important aspect of materials science. The term stereology dates to 1960â€™s and it relates the 2-D images of the microstructures with the 3-D images and structures. In stereology, geometrical features of the structure of the material are quantified using various types of methods. Many mathematical tools are used to transform the 2D measurements made on a planar microstructure to 3D parameters of the structure of the solids. Elements of microstructures:
