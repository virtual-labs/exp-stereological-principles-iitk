Using two-dimensional images, stereology is a quantitative technique that estimates the three-dimensional properties of biological structures. This method is frequently used in many disciplines, such as biology, medicine, and materials science. The following is a general protocol for processing and analysing stereological images:</br></br>
<b>•Image acquisition</b>- Use a suitable imaging system, such as a light, confocal, or electron microscope, to obtain high-resolution images of the specimen.  Make sure that all acquired images have the same imaging parameters (magnification, resolution, etc.).</br></br>
<b>•	Selection of Regions of Interests (ROIs)</b>- Determine and pick out representative interest areas for analysis from the images. Select ROIs at random to guarantee fair sampling. Make sure the ROIs chosen to encompass the whole structure of interest.</br></br>
<b>• Image preprocessing</b>- Adjust for distortion, unequal lighting, and background noise in the image. When necessary, apply image filters or adjustments to boost contrast and make structures more visible.</br></br>
<b>•	Calibration</b>- To translate pixel dimensions into tangible units (like micrometres), calibrate the images. Make sure that every image has the same calibration.</br></br>
<b>• Grid system</b>	- Overlay the pictures with a grid or a sequence of arbitrary test points. The ROIs are systematically sampled using this grid. Make sure the points or grid are spaced equally across the images.</br></br>
<b>•	Point counting</b>- Determine how many points fall on and how many fall outside of the structures of interest, such as cells or particles. To determine the structures' volume or area fractions, apply the point-counting method.</br></br>
<b>•	Intersection counting</b>- Use intersection counting when examining structures (such as tissue sections) that intersect a predetermined plane. Determine how many times the structures and lines of a test system (such as a cycloid or line segments) intersect.</br></br>
<b>•	Cavalieri principle (volume estimation)</b>- Make use of the Cavalieri principle when estimating volumes. To estimate the total volume, multiply the area of each section by the spacing between them.</br> </br>
<b>•	Stereological Formulae</b>- Apply stereological formulas (volume fraction, surface area, length, number of objects) that are relevant to the analysis.</br></br>
<b>•	Statistical analysis</b>- To evaluate the significance and variability of the stereological estimates, do a statistical analysis. Compute confidence intervals and standard errors.</br></br>
<b>•	Data presentation</b>- Provide the stereological data in an understandable and well-structured way. To show the results, make tables, charts, or graphs.</br></br>
<b>•	Validation</b>- Verify the stereological results by contrasting them with those obtained from other techniques or by evaluating the effects of different sampling parameters.</br></br>
<b>•	Documentation and reportin</b>- Record the methodology, taking note of the sampling techniques, imaging parameters, and stereological computations. Provide a clear report of the findings, together with any estimates and related uncertainties.
